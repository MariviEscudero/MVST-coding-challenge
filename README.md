# MVST coding challenge

The task is to display the user GitHub repositories and allow to filter through the repositories by name using a search bar. 

## Usage

The project is based on GitHub API REST, with user data and repositories list with a filter that allows search them by name.
The main page shows user information and repositories with the filter bar tool.

## Installation

What do you need to install the software?

You need to have installed Node JS

1. Download this repository in zip or clone the repository on your device (if you clone the repository, note that you will not be able to add your commits).
2. Open a terminal in the root folder of your repository.
3. Install the local dependencies by running the command in the terminal:

```
npm install
```
Once you have done the previous step, start the project. To do this, run the command:

```
npm start
```

Then you can see that:

- A window will open in your pre-finished browser, which will display your website.
- The files you will be working on are inside the `src/` folder.
