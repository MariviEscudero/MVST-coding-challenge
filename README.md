The task is to display the user GitHub repositories and allow to filter through the repositories by name using a search bar. 
## Future improvements

I had liked to finish all the issues of this project, I had learned about the thechnologies that I don't use, but not enough to do a good job with them, so these are the improvements ready to be done when I reach the knowledge

- Migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript
- Imrovement of test
- Migrate from  GitHub API REST to V4 API, which is built using GraphQL
- Code documented
## Feedback about this challenge

I have enjoyed doing this project, an learning about technologies that I dont't use, and practicing and learning more about the languages that I know. Thank yoy very much for this time and for the opportunity.
I also appreciate the information provided on UX and code documentation, it has been very useful to improve the work and interesting.

## Usage

The project is based on GitHub API REST, with user data and repositories list with a filter that allows search them by name.
The main page shows user information and repositories with the filter bar tool.
